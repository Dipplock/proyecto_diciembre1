        Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. is a fictional paper sales company featured in the American television series The Office. It is analogous to Wernham Hogg in the British original of the series, and Papiers Jennings and Cogirep in the French Canadian and French adaptations, respectively. Originally, the company was completely fictitious, but eventually, the brand was used to sell products at Staples and other office supply outlets.
Two websites were created to support the fictional company, one with the image of a public website, and one meant to look like the corporation's intranet.[3] NBC sold branded merchandise at its NBC Universal Store website.[4] Its logo was prominently displayed in several locations in downtown Scranton, Pennsylvania, where the show is set. Scranton has been associated internationally with Dunder Mifflin due to the show's international reach. In a 2008 St. Patrick's Day speech in the suburb of Dickson City, then-Taoiseach, or prime minister of Ireland, Bertie Ahern, made a reference to the city's fictional branch office.
